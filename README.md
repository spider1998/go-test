    Don't forget, that you need the GTK-Development-Packages.If you use linux, you should install libgtk+-2.0 and packages that depend on gtk.
    On Debian and Debian derived distributions you can run (as root):
    apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtksourceview2.0-dev
    If you use windows, find gtk binary packages from here:
